# Submission 1

This repository holds the data and hyperparameter values for our paper titled as:
`A Study on Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Graph Neural Networks for Web Of Things`

## Data
Not all datasets found in the paper could be published publicly for confidentiality reasons. More datasets may be added in the future. 
The following datasets from the paper are available in json format (1 file for nodes and 1 file for edges):
- AC : ac20* files
- Geonames : geonamesGB* files 
- Poles : poles* files

## Hyperparameters
Since we performed a lot of experiments using KGE methods and also GNN methods, the list of hyperparameters is a bit huge. We have saved the hyperparameter values in a `json` file for each experiment. You can easily navigate the `Hyperparameter` folder to find any hyperparameter values that you are looking for.
